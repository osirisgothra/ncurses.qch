<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This is an extension to the curses library.
It provides callers with a hook into the <B>ncurses</B> data to resize windows,
primarily for use by programs running in an X Window terminal (e.g., xterm).
The function <B>resizeterm</B> resizes the standard and current windows
to the specified dimensions, and adjusts other bookkeeping data used by
the <B>ncurses</B> library that record the window dimensions
such as the <B>LINES</B> and <B>COLS</B> variables.
<P>

Most of the work is done by the inner function <B>resize_term</B>.
The outer function <B>resizeterm</B> adds bookkeeping for the SIGWINCH handler.
When resizing the windows,
<B>resize_term</B> blank-fills the areas that are extended.
The calling application should fill in these areas with appropriate data.
The <B>resize_term</B> function attempts to resize all windows.
However, due to the calling convention of pads,
it is not possible to resize these
without additional interaction with the application.
<P>

A support function <B>is_term_resized</B> is provided so that applications
can check if the <B>resize_term</B> function would modify the window structures.
It returns TRUE if the windows would be modified, and FALSE otherwise.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Except as noted, these functions return
the integer <B>ERR</B> upon failure and <B>OK</B> on success.
They will fail if either of the dimensions are less than or equal to zero,
or if an error occurs while (re)allocating memory for the windows.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

While these functions are intended to be used to support a signal handler
(i.e., for SIGWINCH), care should be taken to avoid invoking them in a
context where <B>malloc</B> or <B>realloc</B> may have been interrupted,
since it uses those functions.
<P>

If ncurses is configured to supply its own SIGWINCH handler,
the <B>resizeterm</B> function <B>ungetch</B>'s a <B>KEY_RESIZE</B> which
will be read on the next call to <B>getch</B>.
This is used to alert an application that the screen size has changed,
and that it should repaint special features such as pads that cannot
be done automatically.
<P>

If the environment variables <B>LINES</B> or <B>COLUMNS</B> are set,
this overrides the library's use of the window size obtained from
the operating system.
Thus, even if a SIGWINCH is received,
no screen size change may be recorded.
